1)
biggest difference between .map and .foreach

=> .forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.

=> .map() iterates a function over each once per item in an array

2)
function vs method
 
=> a function is a block of code that exists independently (usually in the same scope) that returns a result.
=> a method can be a function but it belongs to an object or class. 

3)
what is a closure ?

=> a closure can be said to be the local environment (or scope) where a function is declared.

4)
Describe the 4 rules of this keyword ?

=> New Binding, Window Binding, Explicit Binding, Implicit Binding

5)
why do we need super() in an extended class

=> properties and methods are not inherently passed down from one object to another in javascript, the super keyword must be used to access and call functions from an object's parent object
